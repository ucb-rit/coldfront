                A user identifier (username and password) is required of all users. You must adhere to LBNL password guidelines. Passwords must not be shared. The password must be changed as soon as possible after an unacceptable exposure or suspected compromise.

                Passwords are checked for integrity on a regular basis. It is the user's responsibility to maintain a strong password that conforms to the LBNL password policy as per RPM policy. Accounts with weak passwords or passphrase less keys will automatically be deactivated upon discovery for security reasons. LBNL is not obligated to notify users prior to account deactivation if they have violated the password policy.

                Users may be required to use a one-time password-generating device to gain access to their clusters. Users are not allowed to offer the OTP credentials to any other third party or host other than the LBNL clusters they are authorized to access.

                Users are asked to access the clusters directly from their workstations and laptops and avoid using other hosts as intermediate hops.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users should not leave their login sessions open and idle for long periods of time and should lock their screens while away from their workstations and laptops.

                IMPORTANT: The number one threat to this cluster is from a compromised endpoint (like your desktop computer) which allows your username/password to be stolen or your session to be hijacked.
