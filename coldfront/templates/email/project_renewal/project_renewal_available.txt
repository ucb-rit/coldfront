Dear project managers of {{ project_name }},

Your {{ computing_allowance_name_long }} will expire on {{ current_allocation_period_end_date }}. You may now request to renew the free allowance for {{ next_allocation_period_name }}, which runs from {{ next_allocation_period_start_date }} to {{ next_allocation_period_end_date }}.

To renew a PI's {{ computing_allowance_name_short }} under {{ project_name }}:

1. Visit the project page: {{ project_detail_url }}, and click on the "Renew Allowance" button.
2. Select the "{{ next_allocation_period_name }}" period and the PI. (If there are multiple PIs, they must be renewed separately.)
3. Fill out the usage survey. Note: This is not the final step of the renewal form.
4. Review your selections and submit.

Here is what to expect after making a request:

- You and the PI should see a project renewal request on the Requests page: {{ requests_url }}.
- The request will be reviewed and approved a few days before {{ next_allocation_period_start_date }}. You and the PI will be notified by email.
- If approved, the request will be processed on {{ next_allocation_period_start_date }}, and {{ num_service_units }} service units will be allocated to {{ project_name }}. You and the PI will be notified by email.

If a PI would like to move their {{ computing_allowance_name_short }} to a different project, their pooling preferences may be updated here: {{ general_renewal_url }}.

If you have any questions, please contact us at {{ support_email }}.

Thank you,
